This is the "all in one" branch, my work-in-progress changes to make asm2memcard an all in one solution for testing memory card mods.  
There are new directives for including assembly inline and from files, as well as functionality to output to Dolphin's game configuration for faster testing.

The completion of this branch is a requirement for my work on Triples to continue.
