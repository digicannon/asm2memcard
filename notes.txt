=== "READY TO FIGHT" color changing ===

Banner ID = 0x1F
Changing C,D,E changes the color of the banner.
8111e60c = byte 1F
+      7 = byte 0C
8111e66c = byte 1F
+      7 = byte 0D
8111e6cc = byte 1F
+      7 = byte 0E

Not sure where this data is loaded from, but it is overwritten every time CSS is loaded.
So, hooking in to the end of CSS_LoadFunction, branch at 80266880.  Replace X Y Z with your values.

=== Checking button presses ===

According to the SSBM Data Sheet, player 1's digital inputs start at 804C1FAC.
Bits: -------- UDLRUDLR ---SYXBA -LRZUDRL
The next player's inputs are offset by 0x44.

I wanted to check if the Start button (byte 3) was pressed on any controller:

lis r14, 0x804C
lbz r15, 0x1FAE(r14)
li r14, 0x10
and r14, r14, r15
cmpwi r14, 0x10
bne not_pressed
; TODO: Other players.
; Do stuff for when Start is pressed

I can find PowerPC documentation for an "andi" instruction but it looks like the GameCube
doesn't have it.  So, had to use an extra register to hold the mask for Start.

=== Rumble Toggle ===

flag addr calc:
r0 = word value at r13 - 0x77c0
r3 = r3 + r0
flag = r3 + 0x1cc0
LoadRumbleFlag stores flag in r3
StoreRumbleFLag stores r4 in flag
Warning: putting breakpoints in these procedures causes weirdness & crashes.

r13 = 804db6a0 (constant)
0 = no rumble, 1 = rumble

So it seems rumble flags (byte 0 or 1) are stored at 8045C380.
4 bytes for 4 players.
This seems to be the same address on every run.

So to toggle, let's check if R was just pressed.
"Just pressed" would mean this frame their is no button press, but there was last frame.
Luckily, Melee keeps track of the previous frame's inputs.

check_last_frame:
	lis r14, 0x804C
	ori r14, r14, 0x1FB3
	lbz r15, 0(r14)
	li r16, 0x20
	and r16, r16, r15
	cmpwi r16, 0x20
	bne skip_toggle_p1
check_this_frame:
	lbz r15, -4(r14)
	li r16, 0x20
	and r16, r16, r15
	cmpwi r16, 0
	bne skip_toggle_p1
toggle_p1:
	lis r14, 0x8045
	ori r14, r14, 0xC380
	lbz r15, 0(r14)
	not r15, r15
	li r16, 1
	and r15, r15, r16
	stb r15, 0(r14)
